        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">Hi, I’m Wei-Hong Li, a amateur bodybuilder. I have been fitness for around five years since when I was a four-year undergraduate student. My idours are Larza, James Grage and Simon Panda, who are famous bodybuilders in bodybuilding industry</p>

        &nbsp;
        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">I am also quite keen on reading and writing. I also quite believe the old saying of "文明其精神，野蛮其体魄" by Chair Mao.</p>

        &nbsp;
        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">Around five years ago (2014) when I was the third year graduate student at Sun Yat-Sen University, I started to go to the gym at Guangdong University of Foreign Studies in order to reduce my weight. With a year's training, I failed as I can not keep regular exercise.</p>
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">In 2015, I got admission from the Sun Yat-Sen University for master degree. At that time, I was the final year graduate student. I was so confused and tried my best to figure out how to built the muscle efficiently.</p>
        </div>

        <div style="text-align:center"><img class="img-responsive center-block" alt="pipeline picture" src="https://WeiHongLee.github.io/images/Fitness-Reading/5-min.jpeg" style="width:60%"></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">After 6 months hard working, I reduced my weight to 70kg. But I found I was not fit enough (shape and curve).</p>
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <div style="text-align:center"><img class="img-responsive center-block" alt="pipeline picture" src="https://WeiHongLee.github.io/images/Fitness-Reading/2-min.jpeg" style="width:40%"></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">In addition to this, I felt that the workout is a bit tedious and it is hard to keep workout every week.</p>
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <div style="text-align:center"><img class="img-responsive center-block" alt="pipeline picture" src="https://WeiHongLee.github.io/images/MyPic.png" style="width:60%"></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">In stead of treating workout as a task, I changed to form it as a habbit as my brother's suggestions. From then on, I went to the gym regularly (4-5 times a week) and trained systematically.</p>
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <div style="text-align:center"><img class="img-responsive center-block" alt="pipeline picture" src="https://WeiHongLee.github.io/images/Fitness-Reading/11-min.jpeg" style="width:60%"></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">In the meanwhile, I started reading books and blog about fitness, where I knew some super stars Lazar, Simon Panda and James Grage, who had a very great impact on my fitness career. Also, I learned something from my young brother.</p>
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">I knew, fitness is not simple. It is the combination of exercise, supplymentation and rest. As a popular saying goes, if you want to be in shape, you need 'train like a beast, eat like a horse and sleep like a baby'.</p>
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <div style="text-align:center"><img class="img-responsive center-block" alt="pipeline picture" src="https://WeiHongLee.github.io/images/Fitness-Reading/4-min.jpeg" style="width:60%"></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">With five years of experience on fitness, I become stronger phisically and mentally. In each training day, I would test which strategy or exercise is the best for a specific piece of muscle. From 2016, I became a fitness trainer to help other students in our ISEE Lab to be in shape or reduce fat. I am very glad to see most of members in our team do regular exercise now and gained a significant success this year. Besides, with the constant training, I am fit now and I am able to do the human flag!</p>
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <div style="text-align:center"><img class="img-responsive center-block" alt="pipeline picture" src="https://WeiHongLee.github.io/images/Fitness-Reading/3-min.jpeg" style="width:60%"></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">In Oct. 2017, I got an oppotunity to conduct the visiting study to be involved in the Royal Newton Project at Queen Mary University of London in the UK. I kept regular exercise in the gym, which is just on the first floor of our lab building, or trained in the park. Although the weather is very cold here in comparison with the weather in GuangZhou, the environment here is extremely nice. I believe I will keep doing exercise at any place, in any time.</p>
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <div style="text-align:center"><img class="img-responsive center-block" alt="pipeline picture" src="https://WeiHongLee.github.io/images/Fitness-Reading/12-min.jpeg" style="width:60%"></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">Beyond to fitness, I kept regular reading, which is a bridge to knowledge.</p>
        </div>
        &nbsp;
        <div style="text-align:center"><img class="img-responsive center-block" alt="pipeline picture" src="https://WeiHongLee.github.io/images/Fitness-Reading/10-min.jpeg" style="width:60%"></div>
        &nbsp;
        <div><p class="abstract text-justify">Apart from research and fitness, I hope I can own a excellent study with a vast quantity of books, spacious space as well as classy chairs, table and furniture. It will be a extremely leisure time to read a book with a very nice cup of tea in such comfy environment. It is also a extremely great place to share Kongfu Tea with my family and friends. By the way, my faviourite tea is Red Tea from Yunnan Province and Dancong Tea from my hometown.</p>
